    "This analysis considers who gains from the implementation of a Universal Basic Income (UBI) in the United States. A UBI in this case is an exogenous positive income shock, the benefits of which may be captured by landlords to the extent that they are able to raise rents on housing, or by renters to the extent that the rental market is competitive.\n",

    "A number of estimates of elasticities exist. The USDA ERS publishes food price elasticities for food away from home and food at home categories (Okrent and Alston, 2012). Using a low-income sample, Friedman and Weinberg (1981) estimate the price elasticity of demand for rental housing at âˆ’0.22 (-0.36 for couples) and the income elasticity of demand for rental housing at 0.36 (0.47 for couples). Mayo (1981) provides a review of estimates of income and price elasticity of demand for housing. Hanushek and Quigley (1980) find price elasticities of -0.64 in Pittsburgh and -0.45 in Phoenix, but account for a delay in housing adjustment that substantially reduces elasticities in the short term.\n",

    "There are a few additional factors that probably should be expanded on. Literature from the 1980s discusses the complications of measuring price and income elasticities of demand for rental housing, since rental housing is in one sense very inelastic (everyone needs a place to live), but in another somewhat elastic (quality, location, and size are not required). In addition, there are significant frictions involved in moving that suggest that rental markets take longer than other markets to move toward a new equilibrium.\n",
