<h3>Research Goals</h3>
<p>My research interests center on experimental economics and management of scarce resources, both cognitive and physical. I'm also interested in research methods, specifically causal inference, machine learning, and ways to avoid the <a href="http://andrewgelman.com/2013/07/24/too-good-to-be-true-the-scientific-mass-production-of-spurious-statistical-significance/">mass production of spurious statistical significance</a>. Some specific topics include:

<ul>
  <li>Machine learning in matching and counterfactuals to aid in causal inference.</li>
  <li>Economic incentives in open science, open data, and reproducible research.</li>
  <li>Climate impacts on the economic value of natural resources.</li>
  <li>Water markets and regulation in situations of abundance and scarcity.</li>
  <li>Beyond average treatment effects: impacts of international trade, minimum wage, and other policies.</li>
  <li>Cognitive scarcity and economic choice.</li>
  <li>Properties of collaborative economies. How they arise, survive, and die.</li>
  <li>Prediction in an era of machine learning and big data.</li>
</ul>
