<p>I'm primarily interested in the intersection between machine learning and causal inference. Machine learning lacks a causal framework, and causal inference runs into trouble with non-parametric models and many covariates. Athey and Imbens (2015) have a great series of presentations at an <a href="https://www.nber.org/econometrics_minicourse_2015/">NBER workshop</a> discussing this topic. For me, this is particularly interesting in economics, especially human behavior and prediction and its policy and business implications. Economic models are often criticized as being out of touch with the real world.  Machine learning provides real-world prediction frameworks, behavioral economics provides psychological background, and causal inference provides a meaningful method of evaluating relationships between variables.</p>
