<p>I am a programmer and data analyst at Washington State University's <a href="http://csanr.cahnrs.wsu.edu">Center for Sustaining Agriculture and Natural Resources</a>, where I use R, python, and SQL to create data visualizations, perform statistical analysis, and process gridded climate data.</p>

<p>I'm primarily interested in the intersection between machine learning and causal inference. Machine learning lacks a causal framework, and causal inference runs into trouble with non-parametric models and many covariates. Athey and Imbens (2015) have a great series of presentations at an <a href="http://www.nber.org/econometrics_minicourse_2015/">NBER workshop</a> discussing this topic. For me, this is particularly interesting in economics, especially human behavior and prediction and its policy and business implications. Economic models are often criticized as being out of touch with the real world.  Machine learning provides real-world prediction frameworks, behavioral economics provides psychological background, and causal inference provides a meaningful method of evaluating relationships between variables.</p>

<p>I've written several useful pieces of software: <a href="https://github.com/potterzot/rnassqs">rnassqs</a> provides easy access to USDA agricultural data from the NASS QuickStats API, <a href="https://github.com/potterzot/rkclass">rkclass</a> provides instrumental variables regression analysis in R, though there are better packages to use for that, <a href="https://github.com/potterzot/napnotes">napnotes</a> is my personal note repository, but also includes a python script to fetch academic article metadata when provided with a DOI. Other software and projects are listed below, and most of my code is available on <a href="http://www.github.com/potterzot">my github repository</a>. Written work is available <a href="written-work">here</a>.</p>

<p>I've been a Linux user for over 15 years, and currently run <a href="https://www.archlinux.org">Arch Linux</a> on my laptop. I write software with <a href="http://www.vim.org/">vim</a>, <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">sublime text</a>, and <a href="https://www.rstudio.com">Rstudio</a>. I tend to use Amazon EC2 instances for quick testing, and also for setting up longer-term projects when necessary.</p>

<p>I'm infrequently active on <a href="http://www.twitter.com/potterzot">twitter</a>, where I mostly follow an assortment of awesome data people.</a>

<p>I also write short stories, some of which are available <a href="/stories">here</a>. </p>
