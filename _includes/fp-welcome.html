<p>I am a phd student in the economics program at Washington State University, where I teach the microeconomics course **[Fundamentals of Microeconomics](https://www.potterzot.com/econs101/)**. I also worked on a project with <a href="https://people.ses.wsu.edu/chouinard">Hayley Chouinard</a>, <a href="https://people.ses.wsu.edu/bradym/">Michael Brady</a>, and <a href="https://people.ses.wsu.edu/wandschneider">Phil Wandschneider</a> to look at roadblocks that may be unique to historically underserved farmers in applying to USDA conservation programs. My <a href="research">research</a> interests have to do with markets for scarce resources and policies to manage them. I'm especially interested in water and land issues in the context of international development, water rights in the American West, and the implications of climate change for agriculture. I'm also interested in the intersection of causal inference and machine learning, and in research methodology and design generally</a>.</p>

<p>I want to do research that has a practical impact, is statistically valid (i.e. no <a href-"https://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/unpublished/p_hacking.pdf">forking paths (pdf)</a>), and is reproducible and replicable. In short, I want my research to matter. I think <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science">open science</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ropensci/rrrpkg">reproducible research methods</a> are an important part of that, and in general I believe in the power of collaborative communities and human ingenuity.

<p>I also like open source software. I've been a Linux user for over 15 years, and currently run <a href="https://www.archlinux.org">Arch Linux</a> on my laptop and desktop. I write software with <a href="https://www.vim.org/">vim</a>, <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">sublime text</a>, and <a href="https://www.rstudio.com">Rstudio</a>. I use PostGIS for geospatial work and jekyll for web development. I'm in the middle of converting to using docker regularly in my workflow.</p>

<p>I've written a few R packages and a few python programs: <a href="https://github.com/potterzot/rnassqs">rnassqs</a> provides easy access to USDA agricultural data from the NASS QuickStats API, <a href="https://github.com/potterzot/rkclass">rkclass</a> provides instrumental variables regression analysis in R, though there are better packages to use for that. Most of my work is available on my <a href="https://www.github.com/potterzot">github profile</a>. Written work is available <a href="written-work">here</a>.</p>

<p>The code to generate this site is open source and available on the <a href="https://github.com/potterzot/potterzot.github.io">site repository</a>, which now includes an extensive <a href="notes">note-taking system</a>, as well as links to my <a href="/files/library.bib">bibtex library</a> and <a href="/files/get_paper.py">get_paper.py</a>, a python script that fetches published article metadata when provided with a DOI.</p>

<p>I'm infrequently active on <a href="https://www.twitter.com/potterzot">twitter</a>, where I mostly follow an assortment of awesome data people.</p>

<p>I also write some <a href="stories">fiction</a>, and in early mornings, you can usually find me on one of my <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/13978348">favorite running trails</a>.</p>
