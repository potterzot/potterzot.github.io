<p>I am a phd student (starting Fall 2016) in the economics program at Washington State University, where I work with the <a href="http://csanr.cahnrs.wsu.edu">Center for Sustaining Agriculture and Natural Resources</a> and professor <a href="https://people.ses.wsu.edu/bradym/">Michael Brady</a>. My <a href="research">research</a> interest is primarily the combination of statistical learning and causal inference and applications to questions about human behavior.</p>

<p>I'm an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science">open science</a> advocate and long-time open source user. I believe in the power of collaborative communities and human ingenuity. <a href="http://software-carpentry.org/">Software Carpentry</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ropensci/rrrpkg">reproducible research methods</a> are close to my heart. I've been a Linux user for over 15 years, and currently run <a href="https://www.archlinux.org">Arch Linux</a> on my laptop. I write software with <a href="http://www.vim.org/">vim</a>, <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">sublime text</a>, and <a href="https://www.rstudio.com">Rstudio</a>. I tend to use Amazon EC2 instances for quick testing, and also for setting up longer-term projects when necessary.</p>

<p>I've written several R packages and a few python programs: <a href="https://github.com/potterzot/rnassqs">rnassqs</a> provides easy access to USDA agricultural data from the NASS QuickStats API, <a href="https://github.com/potterzot/rkclass">rkclass</a> provides instrumental variables regression analysis in R, though there are better packages to use for that. Most of my work is available on my <a href="http://www.github.com/potterzot">github profile</a>. Written work is available <a href="written-work">here</a>.</p>

<p>The code to generate this site is open source and available on the <a href="http://github.com/potterzot/potterzot.github.io">site repository</a>, which now includes an extensive <a href="notes">note-taking system</a>, as well as links to my <a href="/files/biblio/library.bib">bibtex library</a> and <a href="/files/biblio/get_paper.py">get_paper.py</a>, a python script that fetches published article metadata when provided with a DOI.</p>

<p>I'm infrequently active on <a href="http://www.twitter.com/potterzot">twitter</a>, where I mostly follow an assortment of awesome data people.</p>

<p>I also write some <a href="stories">fiction</a>, and in early mornings, you can usually find me on one of my <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/13978348">favorite running trails</a>.</p>
