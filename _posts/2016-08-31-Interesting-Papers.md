title: Interesting Papers for August 2016
---

This is a list of papers that I've found interesting in the past month. Not all are new or even relatively new, but they're new to me.

* James D. Hamilton. "Why you should never use the Hodrick-Prescott filter." Available: [pdf](https://econweb.ucsd.edu/~jhamilto/hp.pdf).
* Ranjit Lall. "How multiple imputation makes a difference." *Political Analysis*, forthcoming. Available: [pdf](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/ranjitlall/files/pa_website_version_1.pdf).
