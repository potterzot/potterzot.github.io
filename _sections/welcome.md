I am a Research Agricultural Economist at the USDA Economic Research Service. I work in the Conservation and Environment Branch with a focus on climate, water supplies and irrigation for agriculture. I am interested in water policy and institutions, the effects of decreasing snowpack on water supplies, and long term implications of changing water supplies in the western U.S. and globally. In my work I make use of __spatial and administrative data__, primarily working with `R` and `python`. 

I am a __certified Software and Data Carpentries instructor__ and regularly teach workshops on research computing skills (e.g. [Maine Medical Center](http://econpotter.com/2019-04-02-mmc/),  [Southwestern Indian Polytechnic Institute](http://econpotter.com/2019-09-25-unm/)).
