I am a PhD Candidate in Economics on the job market in 2021. Professor Michael Brady is my Chair. __My research focuses on economic issues related to water, climate, and agriculture, primarily in arid regions__. I am interested in water policy and institutions, the effects of decreasing snowpack on water supplies, and long term implications of changing water supplies in the western U.S. and globally. In my work I make use of __spatial and administrative data__, primarily working with `R` and `python` and using `AWS` instances and `postgres + postgis` where needed. I am currently a research assistant for professors Jonathan Yoder and Joseph Cook, where I work with parcel and water right data and __help design and implement water market experiments__ using `python` and `oTree`.

I am a __certified Software and Data Carpentries instructor__ and regularly teach workshops on research computing skills (e.g. [Maine Medical Center](http://econpotter.com/2019-04-02-mmc/),  [Southwestern Indian Polytechnic Institute](http://econpotter.com/2019-09-25-unm/)). My teaching approach is informed by this experience -- I make my classes as __experiential as possible__ and offer __frequent opportunities for students to provide feedback__. This approach garnered high student evaluations for a microeconomics to a class of almost 200 students that I taught in Fall 2018.
