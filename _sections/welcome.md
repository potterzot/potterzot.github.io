I am a Research Agricultural Economist at the USDA Economic Research Service. I work in the Conservation and Environment Branch with a focus on drought, water supplies, and irrigated agriculture. I am interested in water policy and institutions and understanding how we can best manage water resources. In my work I make use of __spatial and administrative data__, primarily working with `R` and `python`. 

I am also a __certified Software and Data Carpentries instructor__ and regularly teach workshops on research computing skills (e.g. [Maine Medical Center](http://econpotter.com/2019-04-02-mmc/),  [Southwestern Indian Polytechnic Institute](http://econpotter.com/2019-09-25-unm/)).
