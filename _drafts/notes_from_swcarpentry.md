* sticky pads for help, so that people who feel shy can still request help w/o speaking up.

* Color coded responses in etherpad is fun.

`sort -rn` gives you reverse numerical sort, so `wc -l *.txt | sort -rn | head -2` gives you the total number of lines and the file with the most lines.

```
for f in `ls`; do head -3 $f; done 

#also parses rexex

```
