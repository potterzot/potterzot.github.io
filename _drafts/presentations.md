Title: Guide to Presenting
Layout: post

I'm not a great presenter. 

### Presentations

* Start with "why", not "what"
* Tell stories rather than stats
* No more than three take away points
* No more than three points per slide
* Video yourself
* One theme per slide - don't combine different measures
* Avoid bullet points
* be 10 minutes or less, or change it up at least every 10 minutes
* 

### Plots

* Title should be conclusion
*
