title: Machine Learning and Economics - 2016 Review
---

This is the first of what I intend to be a semiannual post reviewing economic papers and research that include some element of machine learning or artificial intelligence. This includes theoretical and applied papers, and could involve for example the use of computer vision to aid in analysis, or the development of a novel way of including machine learning in causal inference.

* [@NaikRaskarHidalgo2016] make use of computer vision and streat level images to create an "evaluative map" for 19 cities to determine in computer vision can evaluate neighborhood appearance in a meaningful way. They conclude that, for their dataset, appearance is positively correlated with median income and population density, while variation of appearance within a neighborhood is strongly correlated with income inequality. The authors suggest further applications in causal inference to evaluate the impact exogenous shocks such as government spending on public goods.

* [@ChalfinETAL2016] expand on the *prediction policy problems* discussed in [@KlienbergETAL2015], including two specific cases in which the impact of hiring additional labor depends heavily on **Which** additional labor is hired. For police and teachers, using ML to predict whether a candidate will perform poorly offers an increase in the *average* quality of service, and a large increase in the quality of service for those citizens or students directly involved with that police officer or teacher.
