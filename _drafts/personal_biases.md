title: Personal Biases
---

In his [EconTalk](https://www.econtalk.org), Russ Roberts often espouses his opinion that, because it's so difficult to tease out causality in complex systems, and because every human has their own biases and pre-drawn conclusions, that empirical research in economics is severely limited, essentially tainted. In one of my favorite episodes, "[Noah Smith on Whether Economics is a Science](https://www.econtalk.org/archives/2015/12/noah_smith_on_w.html)", Noah and Russ discuss this idea in some detail, with the disagreement basically coming down to whether you think humans (and economists in particular) are capable of maintaining a degree of objectivity (as Noah does), or whether you think that objectivity is not only rare but not incentivized (Russ' position). 

In my own aspirations to be a 'good' researcher, I like to think that I can maintain some kind of objectivity in my own work, though I can certainly see how my own feelings and biases have pushed me in different research directions. And especially early in my research career, I think that the line between objective research and advocacy was at times muddy.

I've never done anything like consciously change results or even without results that weren't what I hoped, but I've certainly seen research, some of my own, not released by clients because it doesn't support their position. This happens all the time in impact economics, where the opportunity cost is routinely ignored and every side has their own economic impact study that supports their position.

Sigh...

Here's my idea: this post will serve as a record of my biases now, the summer before starting my PhD program in economics at Washington State University. After I graduate, maybe even every year, I can look back on this post and write an update on how my biases have changed and how they've affected my work. 

The other reason I think this will be interesting is that there is a tradition spanning at least a few decades of researchers arguing that studying economics makes people more selfish (though, it seems to be more of an old joke at this point, given Frey and Meier 2005 [@FreyMeier2005], LaBand and Beil 1999 [@LabandBeil2005], and others).

If I had to synthesize the points below, I could identify a few basic beliefs: 

* All things have value and deserve respect. Living things in particular. Everyone wants to be loved.
* Power corrupts, and the best check against power is openness, free speech, and competitive markets.
* People are basically good, and want to contribute to their community, even without renumeration.
* Objective research can provide answers, even in a complex field like economics. But advocacy-based research significantly muddies the water.

In more detail, and in no particular order:

1. As my high school English Literature teacher said, you have to decide whether people are basically good, basically bad, or blank slates. I think people are basically good. There are a very small minority who are not, and most everyone else, even people who do evil things, are doing their best given their life and their experience. We are social animals, and people motivated to be contributing members of society, for their own sense of self worth if nothing else. The number of people who actually want to mooch off of a support system is relatively small, and most users of social support programs like welfare are on it because they are trying to make ends meet, not because they want to sit around and do nothing all day. In short, **it is lack of opportuniy, not innate human selfishness, that leads to persistent poverty and welfare use**. Similarly, environment, not innate badness, is the primary cause of violent behavior. 

2. This does not excuse anyone from their own actions, but it does assert that people who do bad things are not necessarily bad. As a consequence I am against the death penalty entirely, though that is at least partially also because there is little evidence to show that it acts as a deterrent.

3. That said, I have no moral problem with eating animals, but I have a strong moral reaction to extremely bad quality of life and insensitive methods of killing said animals. From what I know of free range, it doesn't provide much of an alternative. I currently feel strongly enough about this to feel some guilt when eating meat, but not enough to go back to being vegetarian. That may change soon.

4. Science works when it is pursued objectively, but advocacy-based science is useless. In fact, I am a skeptic generally. My first reaction when hearing about some new research is "What is the motivation for doing this research?" My second question is "Have they taken the opportunity cost into account?" I've worked for advocacy-oriented research projects in the past, and I've seen enough to distrust most research.

5. I believe that openness in research, as manifest by open data, reproducible research practices, and general public availability is the best (and perhaps the only) way of reducing the prevalence of advocacy-based science and allowing objective truth-seeking to take center stage. 

6. Power is important, and absolute power makes me very uncomfortable. For government, the best check against this is legally required open access to data and information, as well as independent oversight. For business, the best check is competition, not regulation. Oligopoly does terrible things to society.

7. Minimum wage laws are generally so little so late that their effect is minimal, which could be why their is no measured employment impact. (Aside: I did some research on this in Santa Fe [[pdf #1](https://bber.unm.edu/media/files/SantaFeEarningsFinalReport.pdf), [pdf #2](https://bber.unm.edu/media/files/EmploymentLivingWageAnalysis.pdf)] some years ago.) Certainly it seems like there must be a level, or perhaps a magnitude of shock, at which businesses would become unprofitable before everything else had time to adjust, but so far the increments have been relatively small, and affected only a small subset of workers.

8. Free trade may be good for overall global production, but it seems clearly bad for specific industries, and especially middle-aged workers in those industries. 

So there you go. I'll revisit this next summer, and it will be interesting to see what has changed.
