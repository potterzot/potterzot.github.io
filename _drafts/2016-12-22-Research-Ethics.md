title: Ethics in Research
---

Science as a method, in which we iterate through hypotheses, testing, accepting, rejecting, proceeding, has yielded advances in technology and knowledge that are unparalleled. But science in context, as part of a human political, social, and economic system, has reached something of a post-truth crossroads.

While I believe that the vast majority of researchers are dedicated to the pursuit of truth, the context in which that happens...

In an effort to avoid th error of deciding that things are now worse than they were in a past I do not know, I will simply say that public trust in science is low and that scientists, moreso in some fields than others, collectively produce a flood of papers that are neither valid nor useful.

I see this as due to a few broad issues: agenda-based sponsorship of science, statistical errors, and shrinking opportunities for new PhDs, all of which are likely to remain issues for the foreseeable future.

Research ethics statements usually revolve around the following ideas:

1. Informed consent by participants and staff.
2. Confidentiality of an individual's data and anonymity of participants. 
3. Participation must be voluntary, and the study should not be harmful.
4. Conflicts of interest must be explicitly stated.
5. Research should be undertaken with integrity.

While these are good principles, I would argue that they do not go far enough. Science is struggling with public trust, especially in the past few years as researchers have found large percentages of studies that fail to replicate. There are many drivers of the failure to replicate, including p-hacking and other statistical errors (whether intentinoal or not), publication bias (the file drawer effect), and outright fraud.

Below I detail additional commitments

#### Openness

#### Accuracy in Reporting



### Impartiality and Objectivity
