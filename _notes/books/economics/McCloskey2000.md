### Chapter 1: Writing is the Economist's Trade

* Good writing pays well, and bad writing pays badly. One of the best ways to be a successful economist is to work at becoming a good writer (and a good speaker)

### Chapter 2: Writing is Thinking

* you can't decouple writing and research. Writing clarifies thought and research. Poorly written papers correlate strongly with poor research

### Chapter 3: Rules can Help, but Bad Rules Hurt

* Be careful with rules, at least try to understand the *why*.
* Do not just replace **I** with **we**. Instead try to make the subject of the article the subject of the sentences.
* Don't follow the "Say what you're going to say, say it, say what you've said" method.
* Not ending sentences with prepositions is ridiculous.
*

### Chapter 4: Be Thou Clear; But for Lord's Sake have Fun, Too

* If someone says something is unclear, then it is, by definition.
* Clarity = speed directed at a point.
* Don't overuse commas.
* Read your writing after a week cold. Look for places you cannot follow with ease and edit them.
* The rules should be used to make writing fun. The goal is to make your writing flow well and be easy to read and understand. Following the rules at the expense of the goal is not useful.
