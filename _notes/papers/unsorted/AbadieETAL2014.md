Approach is as follows:

1. Formally define a population and how sampling occurs.
2. Define an [estimand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimand) (e.g. some measure of how the treatment affects the population).
estimand that answers the economic question of import.
3. Specify what data are missing and how the difference between estimator and estimand is uncertain. E.g. Given data on 50 states from 2003, we know difference in average income between coast and inland. We could use that to estimate 2004, but error would include serial correlation w/in states and no direct cross-section data.
