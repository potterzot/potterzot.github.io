####Notes
Approach is as follows:

1. Formally define a population and how sampling occurs.
2. Define an estimand that answers the economic question of import.
3. Specify what data are missing and how the difference between estimator and estimand is uncertain. E.g. Given data on 50 states from 2003, we know difference in average income between coast and inland. We could use that to estimate 2004, but error would include serial correlation w/in states and no direct cross-section data.


DEF: [Estimand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimand) is that which is to be estimated (e.g. some measure of how the treatment affects the population).
