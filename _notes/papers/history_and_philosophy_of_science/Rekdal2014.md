#### Summary
There are some great myths that seem to perpetuate in science. Here Rekdal discusses at length the myth (truth?) that spinach is high in iron. I'm left uncertain of what the truth is in this case. Basic point: always go back to the original source. Secondary sources may not appropriately interpret or may quote out of context.
