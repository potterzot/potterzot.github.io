####Notes
Vector Auto Regression (VAR) with bayesian shrinkage can be an excellent tool for large dynamic models. If the shrinkage parameter is set in relation to the cross-sectional dimension, the forecasting accuracy of the model can be improved by including additional macroeconomic variables.

VARs typically include 3-10 variables because otherwise the number of estimated coefficients becomes too large. As a result there is a significant chance of omitted variable bias (OVB).
