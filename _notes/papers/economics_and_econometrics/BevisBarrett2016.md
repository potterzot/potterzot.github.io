#### Data
Data are plot-level panel data from Uganda from two surveys taken a decade apart (2003 by IFPRI and 2013 by NSF-funded), spatially matched across time by their gps coordinates. Plot shape and size shifted during that time, allowing the examination of the same land under different plot configurations. 859 households in 2003, 803 of which were interviewed in 2013.

#### General Notes
Inverse Productivity Relationship is that small farms seem to be more productive than large ones. Authors indicate that this is relatively established as true. Previous explanations include:

* labor market failures that drive high shadow prices for labor for larger farmers, so that small farms have more productive labor per cost (@Sen1966, @Feder1985).
* spurious correlation resulting from measurement error around farm size (@Lamb2003) or OVB if farm size is endogenous to soil quality, in that more fertile soils induce both higher yields and denser settlement patterns (BhallaRoy1988, @Benjamin1995). 

Several papers suggest that household effects are not sufficiently explantory (@KaginTaylorYunez-Naude2015, @BarrettBellamareHou2010, @CarlettoSavastanoZezza2013).

Authors suggest that the reason is behavioral: Farmers naturally pay more attention to what is happening on the edges of their field than in the middle. Since perimeter ($$ p = 2(l + w) $$) increases linearly and area ($$ a = lw$$) increases quadratically (for a square at least), larger farms have a smaller perimeter-to-area ratio. However, authors cannot rule out that factors like greater access to sunlight, water, or nutrients on the perimeter could be a contributing factor.

#### Thoughts
* The cited papers as evidence discrediting other explanations are by a small set of authors, one of whom is the author: Barrett, Bellemare, Hou, Carletto, Savastano, Zezza. The issue may not be as settled as indicated by their tone.
* I'm not sure that their estimate of periphery makes sense. They use $$ p/A $$, where $$ p $$ is periphery and $$ A $$ is area, with $$ b $$ defining the width of the periphery observed by the farmer. In Appendix 4, authors argue that plot area has no additional explanatory power after the $$ p/A $$ ratio is controlled for. Something seems a little off in this, but not sure what.
