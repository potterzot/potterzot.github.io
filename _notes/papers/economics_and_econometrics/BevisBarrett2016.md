Data are plot-level panel data from Uganda

Inverse Productivity Relationship is that small farms seem to be more productive than large ones. Authors indicate that this is relatively established as true. Previous explanations include:

* labor market failures that drive high shadow prices for labor for larger farmers, so that small farms have more productive labor per cost (@Sen1966, @Feder1985).
* spurious correlation resulting from measurement error around farm size (@Lamb2003) or OVB if farm size is endogenous to soil quality, in that more fertile soils induce both higher yields and denser settlement patterns (@BhallaRoy1988, @Benjamin1995). 

Suggest that the reason is behavioral: Farmers naturally pay more attention to what is happening on the edges of their field than in the middle. Since perimeter ($$ p = 2(l + w) $$) increases linearly and area ($$ a = lw$$) increases quadratically (for a square at least), larger farms have a smaller perimeter-to-area ratio. However, authors cannot rule out that factors like greater access to sunlight, water, or nutrients on the perimeter could be a contributing factor.
