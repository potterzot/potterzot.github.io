* rapid diffusion of open source software
* significant capital investments in open source projects, and companies specializing in open source
* collaborative nature of OSS

Should look at @Rosenberg1976 and @vonHippel1988 for examples of non-software user-driven innovation

"Open Science" term comes from @DasguptaDavid1994?

"... greatest diffusion of OSS appears to be in settings where end users are sophisticated." [Is this true?]


**Programmer Motivation**
Costs:
* opportunity cost of time

Pros:
* signaling knowledge, either to peers or to future employers
* potential satisfaction/interest/more fun
* can choose what to work on

Why don't original creators make it private? Article argues that they should, but there are several reasons I can think off the top of my head:
* they have similar costs/benefits as above, with added cost of foregone profits from privatization
* community movitation and culture play a large role, so the "value" of releasing it open source may be large emotionally
* project may be more likely to succeed if OS, since others might contribute. A private project has to fund it's own development

**OSS Benefits vs Closed Source**
* With CS, it's difficult/imperfect to evaluate the functionality. OS you can read the code.
* OS creator is fully invested relative to CS, for whom the work is just a job
* OS has ease of trasnferrence, reducing friction, learning costs, etc...

Giving credit to authors is essential in OSS

At time of authorship, companies didn't often release OSS, but that has changed significantly. Many private entities release OSS now.
