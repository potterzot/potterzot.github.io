####Notes
@BehavioralEconomics dictator games suggest that a utility function with a combination of ex post (after the uncertainty is resolved) and ex ante (before resolution of uncertainty) concerns may best describe behavior.

The more money being transferred in the dictator game, the more likely players attempt to equalize payoff chances under risk. But risk to the recipient does generally decrease the amount transferred.

I.e., people behave as if they account for both risk before the game is played and then also after the game is over.
