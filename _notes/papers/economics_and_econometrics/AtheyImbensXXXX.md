####Notes
**Research Proposal**

* Formally model the distinction between causal and predictive parts of a model and treat them differently as in AbadieETAL2014.
* Develop estimation methods that combine ML for prediction with causal approaches. One software example of this is [CausalImpact](https://google.github.io/CausalImpact/).
* Develop new CV methods optimized for causal inference.
* Develop robustness measures for causal parameters inspired by ML.
