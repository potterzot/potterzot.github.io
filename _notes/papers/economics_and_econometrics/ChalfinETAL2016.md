Main take away is that ML can be used to offer better predictions in cases where policy or the decision to be made depends on **which** unit is selected. In this case, *which* policy officer or *which* teacher. Using ML to predict which candidates will be worst allows for a significant improvement in outcomes versus a simple ranking algorithm.
