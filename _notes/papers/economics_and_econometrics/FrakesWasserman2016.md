####Notes
Examiners are more likely to grant patents as they are promoted, possibly suggesting that as they have less time to review patents, they are more likely to grant them. In addition, there is evidence that the patents granted are of lower quality on average.

Possible issue: How did they address that maybe the reviewer simply becomes more pro-patent as they get promoted? Presumably there is an interaction between how pro-patent a reviewer is and the likelihood of being promoted.
