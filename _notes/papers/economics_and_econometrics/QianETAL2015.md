Abstract claims "economically significant" reduction in obesity from FFVP, but results in Table 4 and 5 show only two tests that were significant and many that were not. In addition, the effect in Table 5 is quite small (-0.03 difference in z-scores). Seems like a more accurate conclusion is: Impact from FFVP is small if it exists at all.
