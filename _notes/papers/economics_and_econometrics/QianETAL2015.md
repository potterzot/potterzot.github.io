The authors argue that the FFVP has "economically significant" impacts, reducing obesity. They measure BMI, but in sevral matching paradigms and other causal measures they find no significant effect. For only two of the ~10 measures is the effect significant. Not that I should harp on p-values, but given that several specifications show no significant difference, the conclusion should be more something like "FFVP likely had little impact on obesity, except potentially a small impact in these specific cases, although it is possible or even likely given the garden-of-forking-paths issues that these are not conclusive."
