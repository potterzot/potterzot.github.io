**Citation:** Leamer, Edward E. "Tantalus on the Road to Asymptopia". *Journal of Economic Perspectives* 24, no. 2 (2010): 31-46. [[Paper link](http://dx.doi.org/10.1257/jep.24.2.31)]

* Look up Deacon 2008
* What was the Cowles Foundation asymptotic properties theory that is referenced as being an "emporer with no clothes" phenomena?

Leamer's Primary concerns seem to be:

1. Numerous confounding variables, which is discussed if I remember right in papers by Newey, Imbens, Bekker, etc...
2. The interactive confounders (see Deaton 2008 and Heckman 1992) do not easily generalize to larger situations.
3. In accidental randomization, IV estimators are very likely to have some inconsistency, some asymptotic bias. This is especially a problem with multiple weak instruments.
4. In true lab experimental settings, extrapolation from lab to real world is troubling at best.
5. Overall, the issue is that metrics requires careful thought and committment to assumptions, but allows for easy violation of those assumptions without thought as to the effects, so it is bound to always be *practiced* in ways that limit its value for knowing the 'truth' of something.

As a result of the above, sensitivity analysis is a necessary part of research. It allows the determination of the range of values to which the results apply. The analysis takes the form

    Include in the equation the treatment variable and a single linear combina- nclude in the equation the treatment variable and a single linear combination of the additive controls. Then fi ion of the additive controls. Then fi nd the linear combination of controls that nd the linear combination of controls that provides the greatest estimated treatment effect and the linear combination that rovides the greatest estimated treatment effect and the linear combination that provides the smallest estimated treatment effect. That corresponds to the range rovides the smallest estimated treatment effect. That corresponds to the range of estimates that can be obtained when it is known that the controls are doubtful f estimates that can be obtained when it is known that the controls are doubtful (zero being the most likely estimate, a priori) but there is complete ambiguity zero being the most likely estimate, a priori) but there is complete ambiguity about the probable importance of the variables, arbitrary scales, and arbitrary bout the probable importance of the variables, arbitrary scales, and arbitrary coordinate systems.

The problem is deeper than rationality or other issues. The problem is that we have a set of data, and the data are compatible with a wide, infinite number of underlying processes (data generating processes). Sensitivity analysis is necessary because of this fundamental uncertainty. We need to know the range of data for which the conclusion is valid.

Three-valued logic: uncertainty implies not just a "yes" or "no", but also an "I don't know" state of mind. We have to be careful when judging the evidence to include this third option.
