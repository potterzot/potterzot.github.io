**Citation:** Galbraith, J.K., 1978. Writing, typing and economics. Atlantic, 241, pp.102-105.

* Discussion is the last resort of an empty academic mind.
* Don't wait for inspiration. Write.
* Five drafts is normal. Four on a good day.
* Mark Twain: The difference between the right adjective and the next-best adjective is the difference between lightning and a lightning-bug.
* Avoid booze.
* Stick to research and reporting with only a minimum of interpretation.
* Avoid humor, solemnity inspires trust. The real world is funny enough.
