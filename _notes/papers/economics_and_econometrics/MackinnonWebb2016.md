####Notes
cluster robust variance estimators rely on a sufficiently large number of clusters, and monte carlo evidence suggests that the 'rule of 42' is not true for unbalanced clusters, leading to higher rejection frequencies in unbalanced cluster data sets. Using the wild cluster bootstrap to determine critical values results in lower rejection frequencies.
