####Summary
Choice experiments assume that individuals behave in accordance with standard utility theory, but their preferences often violate that assumtion, impacting willingness-to-pay (WTP) estimates. Using survey data aimed at valuing the environmental and social impacts of organic farming in mountainous olive-orchards, authors show that inconsistent choices can bias WTP estimates.
