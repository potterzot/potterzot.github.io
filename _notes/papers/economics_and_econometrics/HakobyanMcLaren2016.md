####Notes
US Census evidence suggests that NAFTA had major adverse effects on wage growth for blue-collar workers as well as service workers in affected localities. In essence, the effects in particularly vulnerable areas are substantially larger than the geographically aggregated effects found in other research.

Findings coincide with the China Shock paper by @AutorDornHanson2016.
