####Summary
Instrumental variables analysis of financial reform with population outcomes suggests that a 10% increase in per pupil spending each year for all 12 years of public school leads to 0.31 more completed years of education, about 7% higher wages, and a 3.2 percentage point reduction in annual incidence of adult poverty. Effects were much more pronounced for children from low-income families (0.46, 9.6%, and 6.1 percentage points respectively).

####Notes
* Criticism of earlier work is that:
  1. Research was based on test scores, but test scores are only weakly linked to adult success, and long run outcomes do not show up well in test scores [@LudwigMiller2007; @Deming2009; Jackson2012 and others]
  2. Correlated actual changes in school spending with changes in student outcomes, but many times funding was contingent on things like proportion of low-income children, which would bias the effects of funding negatively.
* Use only court-mandated finance reform
* Used geocoded confidential PSID data from NCES, USDE. 
* Able to reconcile with previous results by showing that observational variation in spending may confound family and neighborhood disadvantage, and that districts often allocated additional funds toward seemingly more productive schools.

**Thoughts**
* Why do authors report three different measures in the abstract?
