####Notes
Ordering of lists of published papers affects which papers are read and cited, with being first providing about a 30% increase in citation. Authors suggest that this is due to skimming behavior, in which users with limited time select a first few and are less likely to read the rest.

Thought: This behavior could also be modeled by "preference exhaustion", where consumers are more likely to pick an option out of the first few, and tend to "shut off" the rest of the options when presented with more than ~3-7.
