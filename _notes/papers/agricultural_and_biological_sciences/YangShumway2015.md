#Summary
A stochastic dynamic model with two aggregate outputs (crops, livestock) and three aggregate inputs (fertlizer, capital, labor) is used to estimate adjustments in reaction to stochastic climate change. Suggests that crops adjust to their long term equilibrium 49% per year, while livestock adjust 20%. Fertilizer adjusts are near instantaneous (88%), while capital adjusts much more slowly (5%). Labor fails to converge.

#Major questions
* Model assumes rational actors, which given familiar difficulties with information collection and evaluation, not to mention things like sunk costs, risk avoidance, etc... suggests that there could be potential other outcomes in real life. No access to the actual paper right now... (#openscience for the win.)
