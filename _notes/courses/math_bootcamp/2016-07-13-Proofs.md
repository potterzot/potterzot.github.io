##Direct Proof

* **Theorems** are true statements that have been proved true, and generally follow the format "*If P, then Q*".
* Less significant theorems are sometimes called **propositions**.
* A **lemma** is a theorem that is mainly used to prove another theorem.
* A **corollary** is an immediate consequence of a theorem.

We can represent "If $$ P $$, then $$ Q $$" as $$ P \Rightarrow Q $$
