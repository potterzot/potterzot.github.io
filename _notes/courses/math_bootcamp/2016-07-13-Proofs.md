Notes on proofs from: Richard Hammack. Book of Proofs, Virginia Commonwealth University, 2013.
Some notes also from: Simon and Blume. Mathematics for Economists. MIT Press, 2001.

## Direct Proof

* **Theorems** are true statements that have been proved true, and generally follow the format "*If P, then Q*".
* Less significant theorems are sometimes called **propositions**.
* A **lemma** is a theorem that is mainly used to prove another theorem.
* A **corollary** is an immediate consequence of a theorem.

We can represent "If $$ P $$, then $$ Q $$" as $$ P \Rightarrow Q $$.

There are four possible results based on whether $$ P $$ and $$ Q $$ are true or false:

| $$ P $$ | $$ Q $$ | $$ P \Rightarrow Q $$ |
| :-----: | :-----: | :-------------------: |
| T | T | T |
| T | F | **F** |
| F | T | T |
| F | F | T |

So to prove $$ P \Rightarrow Q $$, we need to show that $$ P $$ being true *forces* $$ Q $$ to be true.

**Example:**

>**Proposition**: If $$ x $$ is odd, then $$ x^2 $$ is also odd.
>
>*Proof*. Suppose $$ x $$ is odd. Then $$ x = 2a + 1 $$ for $$ a \in \Re $$. If $$ x^2 $$ is also odd, then $$ x^2 = 2b + 1 $$ for some $$ b \in \Re $$. Substituting, $$ x^2 = 2b + 1 = (2a + 1)^2 $$, so $$ b = \frac{(2a + 1)^2 - 1}{2} = 2a(a+1) $$. Thus $$ x^2 $$ is odd.
