### Definitions

Basic definitions to build up from.

* **Experiment**: has two components: (1) final result/outcome is not known, and (2) all potential outcomes are known or can at least be defined/categorized.
* **Outcome**: the final result/event.
* **Sample Space**: The set that contains all of the possible outcomes, i.e. $$S = \{0, 1\}$$.
* **Element of the Sample Space**: A member of the sample space set.
* **Size of the Sample Space**: There are three types: (1) finite, (2) countably finite, and (3) uncountably finite. The first two are **discrete**, the third is **continuous**.
* **Event**: A subset of the sample space. An **elementary event** is a singleton set of the sample space. E.g. $$\{0\}$$ from $$\{0,1\}$$.
* **Disjoint**: Two events or subsets are disjoint if $$A \cap B = \{\emptyset\}$$.
