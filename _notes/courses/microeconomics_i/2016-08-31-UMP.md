title: "Utility Maximization Problem"
course: "micro_i"
---

Given the budget constraints and utility function, the consumer wants to maximize their utility, so

$$\max_{x \ge 0} u(x)$$ s. t. $$p \cdot x \le w$$.

$$x, p$$ are vectors of goods and prices, and $$w$$ is wealth.

**Weierstrass Theorem**: If utility function is continuous and the constraints define a closed and bounded set, then a solution exists.

If preferences are strictly convex the solution is unique.

*Homogenous of degree 0*, since $$x(p,w) = x(\alpha p, \alpha w)$$. Intuitive, since increasing wealth and cost by the same amount doesn't change the bundle.

**Walras' Law**: $$p \cdot x \le w$$. Of course...

**Steps to solve**:

1. Take the lagrangian and solve for each partial
2. Solve the partial for one good in terms of the other(s)
3. sub into the wealth constraint
4. solve for the other good
5. get $$x_i = \ldots$$ in terms of $$p$$ and $$w$$.
6. sub those into $$u$$ to get $$v(p,w)$$, the value function.

**Important**

* The solution is a max and not a min only if $$u$$ is *quasiconcave*, *monotone*, and the *gradient of $$u$$, $$\nabla u(x) \neq 0$$*.
