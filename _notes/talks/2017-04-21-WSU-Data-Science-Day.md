### Talk 1 (PNWL):

* Finite topologies for non-rectangular data integration


### Talk 2 (Open data observatories):

* Urban data observatories
* There is no good friendly library for video analysis. Need to be able to chop videos to create time series of the same image/area from a camera/set of sensors.
* **Open problems**: Nonnegative Matrix Factorization: number of components, orderdness of PCA, independence of ICA,


### Talk 3 (LANL):

* Uncertainty about functions


### Sensory Panel Training

Charles Daiko, WSU-FSHN

* Attributes of a good (e.g. coffee), vary between sample of people. How do we transfer from a complex and mixed/contradictory set of data to something that conforms, especially when attributes interact.
* Issues like people who reply with middle on every question, others who get a halo effect and report everything as great, etc... Need to be able to decompose those somehow.

### Measuring Economic Growth

Justin Theriot, EMSI

* How do we measure economic growth?

### Satellite Imagery

Rich Chartrand, Descartes Labs

* How to process 5PB of satellite imagery?
* They have a python API
* GeoVisual Search
