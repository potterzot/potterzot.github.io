### Richard Shumway's Rules for Achieving Success in Life

* Choose research topics carefully, be sure they are important, be confident you can make a valuable contribution, and write down why because sometimes while completing a research project you will become convinced it is worthless.
* Research isn't done until it is clearly communicated; neither are most things that are worthwhile.
* Listen carefully, respond positively to all advice and reviews, revise willingly, but be tenacious, especially when reviewers say your paper is worthless and you know it isn't.
* Remember economics is both important and fun but it isn't life, so if things don't work out as hoped, do something else.
* Work hard but take a day off every week.
* People are more important than things, so be a good friend, a faithful family member, and serve well.
* Spiritual harmony provides the greatest peace.
* Relationships and spiritual wellbeing are the only things that matter when drawing a final breath.
* Eat well, exercise body and mind, and nourish the spirit every day.



### Estimating Dual Headed Time in Food Production with Implications for SNAP Benefits
George Davis, Virginia Tech University

**Is SNAP sufficient for nutritional requirements?**

Basic idea is that SNAP estimates don't include the value of labor and the consumer tradeoff between time to prepare a meal and cost of food. SNAP is awarded based on income relative to a minimum cost needed (Thrifty Food Plan (TFP)) for full nutrition. However, taking into account labor costs, SNAP is less sufficient for covering food costs by about $50/wk. This is not as high for dual-headed households since the non-main meal parent can help with labor.

* SNAP can only be used for basic foods used in home production, i.e. not restaurants or even deli prepared food from the grocery.
* There is a NLP model that is used to set the basis for maximum SNAP benefits. Constrained on nutrition and costs
* Model ignores labor costs / time input of parent/provider.
* What is the appropriate baseline we should be comparing expenditures to?
* Thrifty Food Plan (TFP) is minimum cost to meet nutritional needs.

### Hick's Marginal Valuations and Inverse Supplies
Lilyan Fulginiti, University of Nebraska - Lincoln

* If you want marginal cost but lacking prices, you can use quantities in an analogous way to determine marginal Valuations, i.e. use quantities to extract the supply side structure.

### A Framework for Analyzing Firm ProSocial Behavior

Spiro, University of Florida

Given multiple outputs and inputs (some bad and some good of both), then have two separate technologies, one that controls positive outputs and one that controls the negative output, and want to optimize over both.

Example: if production uses coal, but coal outputs pollution.

* "Corporate Social Responsibility" (CSR)

### Is Localization Changing Over Time?

Andrew Cassey, WSU

Estimation of nondisclosed data to create a repeated cross-section of data to be able to answer questions like "Is localization changing in the US?"

* Localization is geographical concentration of employment for an industry is larger than concentration for overall industry. (e.g. food processing vs. overall manufacturing.)

* Naive approach is location quotients. Instead can use Ellison and Glaeser index (1997), which accounts for industrial organization patterns.

* issue: census bureau changes its definition of industries over time.

* issue: firms may also change how they self-identify in terms of industry, depending on which industry they have the most sales in in a given year.

* kim (1995) US finds localization decreasing over time from 0.196 to 0.153 using "locational Gini coefficient."

* Ellison-Glaeser (EG) is ...

* No discernible pattern in food processing. At NAICS6, some are becoming more localized, some less, etc...

### Trade Costs of Pests and Pathogens

Tom Marsh, WSU

* 70% of world's poor are dependent on livestock
* livestock diseases have significant impacts on health, trade, and even conflict.
* Foot and Mouth Disease is endemic in Tanzania and is a big reason (conventionally) for the lack of trade from Tanzania.
* Perrings ETAL 2010
