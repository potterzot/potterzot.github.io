1. Listen a lot
2. Focus on getting the meaning first
3. Start mixing word types. 10 verbs, 10 nouns, 10 adjectives, etc... Get creative
4. Focus on the core words. 1000 words covers 85% of what you'll say ever
5. Start with the toolbox: "how do you say that" "I don't understand", "repeat that", etc...
6. Get a language parent 
7. Copy the face of speakers
8. relate words to images. Identify the things you see with words you know. Do not try to relate words in English to words in other language.
