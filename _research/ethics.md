title: Resesarch Ethics Statement
---

My research ethics are simple: engage in honest scientific pursuits, and do not restrict life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.

To me science is the pursuit of knowledge. If I take a position based on emotion and then search for evidence to support it, I'm not pursuing knowledge, I'm engaging in politics. If I accept payment in order to arrive at a specific conclusion, I'm not only not contributing knowledge, I'm corrupting what knowledge we have. If my work causes pain and suffering, I may be doing research, but it's research that enriches myself at significant cost to others.

With this as my ethical base and perspective, I commit to the following (in no particular order):

* I will endeavor to respect every person, period.

* I will pursue research with the explicit goal of increasing knowledge, and in doing so I reject beginning with a specific answer or result in mind.

* I will endeavor to create space for an open marketplace of ideas, dismissing nothing out of hand.

* I will not accept funding of any kind that seeks to obtain a foregone conclusion, period.

* I will pursue transparency and open science [best practices](https://cos.io/our-communities/scientists-and-researchers/) in my research, and work hard to limit the possibility of statistical fallacies, whether due to the [garden of forking paths](https://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/unpublished/p_hacking.pdf) or other pitfalls.

* I will make all of my research publicly available to the extent I'm allowed, whether the results are 'significant' or not. This includes making data, and code available when possible. I will work to make this possible every time.

* I will not engage in research that causes loss of life, restriction of liberty, or restriction of the pursuit of happiness.

I recognize that the interpretation of these statements is complex and fraught with inconsistencies. But much like the constitution of the United States, it is a living document. I will do my best to interpret it in as intellectually honest a way as possible.
