##potterzot.com source code

Web site and attached blog built in Jekyll, hosted on github with a domain CNAME to point potterzot.com to potterzot.github.io. Based on Lincoln Mullen's [site](httpss://github.com/lmullen/lincolnmullen.com).

Also includes my note-taking system, written in markdown to enable easy notes but math equations, and a python script to fetch paper metadata and create a skeleton markdown file when given an article DOI. More info <a href="https://www.potterzot.com/notes/">here</a>.


##To Use

First, fork this repository and then rename it to your web site name. You'll have to change the domain name in `CNAME`, the options in `_config.yml`, and remove the various content pages. You'll also have to have [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) installed and various associated gems.
